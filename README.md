# Optimal-Habitat-Configuration-Species-Persistence-
This project is centered around a geometric abstraction (first-principles) of the Kolmogorov-Fisher equations in Reaction-Diffusion models with the aim of emulating the partial differential equations describing optimal habitat configuration responsible for species persistence
